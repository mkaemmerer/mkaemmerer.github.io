A few months ago, my fiancée was talking on a video call with a friend of ours who was sick.
She made a joke about trying to pass him a bowl of soup through the screen,
and in doing so planted the seed for a new design project.

We talked later about how great it would be if we really *could* send soup over the internet
&mdash;or could at least convey the warmth and comfort of soup.
What would be the best way to do it?
Email felt too cold, and often doesn't show the level of thoughtfulness we wanted.
Hallmark cards demonstrate an inappropriate level of concern for anyone with less than a broken leg.
Ecards don't match the reality of a sick person bundled up in bed with only their mobile phone to read.

So we designed something that aims to be *just right*.
Something broad enough that you could share it with a coworker, or your close friends.
A simple message to let someone know you care, with an easy-to-remember web address.

This week, we finally made the time to build it. You can see the result at [virtualsoup.me](http://www.virtualsoup.me).

Share it with your coworkers, friends, family members, and loved ones when they are sick.
We hope it brings them some comfort and a smile.
