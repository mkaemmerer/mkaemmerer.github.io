I was feeling a little nostalgic lately, so I decided it was time to revive an old snack classic.
These peanut butter bees are a snack my mom helped me make a few times when I was in grade school.
I made a batch a few days ago.
They were a smash hit with my friends who had never seen or heard of peanut butter bees before!

I had a little bit of trouble finding the recipe for them.
Not for a lack of search results for "peanut butter bees,"
but because none of the results seemed *quite* right.
See, the peanut butter bees of my childhood didn't have stripes made with melted chocolate.
We drew eyes and stripes on using a toothpick covered in cocoa powder.
I also don't remember using graham cracker crumbs (I think we used evaporated milk as a binder instead).
Did they have honey in them too?
I can't remember if they *actually* did, or if I just made that connection because, well, they're bees.

In any case, if you've never had peaunt butter bees,
you should head on over to [Zoom](http://pbskids.org/zoom/activities/cafe/peanutbutterbees.html).
They have the closest recipe I could find to what I remember making as a kid.

If you have had peanut butter bees before, stick with what you know.
I'm sure the melted-chocolate striped bees would have been just as delicious.
But to me, the cocoa powder striped bees are the more authentic, and **clearly superior** peanut butter bee.
If your recipe calls for butter, you might be able to substitute shortening, but there's really no substitute for nostalgia.
